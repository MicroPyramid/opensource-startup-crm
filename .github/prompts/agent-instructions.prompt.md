Dear copilot,

This is modern CRM with tech stack as sveltekit, prisma orm, etc.

## DB
Use prisma/schema.prisma to refer models

## code style
* Always refer prisma models when writing code related to CRUD.
* always try to use form actions instead of writing sveltekit apis to achieve functionalities.
* UI should be modern and responsive
* UI should be developed using flowbite-svelte + tailwindcss
* refer hooks file to see about authenticated user and org attached to sveltekit locals variable
